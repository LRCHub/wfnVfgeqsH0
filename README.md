[00:08.16] I'm walking alone, the streets are empty
[00:12.04] The only thing I can see is my own silhouette
[00:15.61] I'm getting stronger, step by step
[00:19.34] The clock is ticking but there is no time for regrets
[00:45.84] 
[00:23.56] I've been flying from town to town
[00:27.15] From London to Taiwan
[00:30.95] I've been all around the globe
[00:34.41] Trying to protect your soul
[00:47.91] 
[00:38.36] We are heroes tonight
[00:42.20] We would fly above the sky
[00:45.89] We are heroes tonight, yeah
[00:53.36] We are heroes tonight
[00:57.38] We would fly above the sky
[01:01.07] We are heroes tonight, yeah
[01:14.57] 
[01:19.12] Night yeah
[01:24.12] 
[01:23.42] Feeling like a dynamite
[01:27.27] Ready to explode right up in the sky
[01:30.66] I need you to listen, I need you to hear
[01:34.64] And don't show any fear
[01:46.14] 
[01:38.56] I've been flying from town to town
[01:42.01] From London to Taiwan
[01:45.96] I've been all around the globe
[01:49.28] Trying to protect your soul
[02:02.78] 
[01:53.46] We are heroes tonight
[01:57.15] We would fly above the sky
[02:00.73] We are heroes tonight, yeah

[02:12.10] We would fly above the sky
[02:16.08] We are heroes tonight, yeah
[02:29.58] 
[02:30.84] We are heroes tonight, yeah
[02:44.34] 
[02:49.19] Night yeah
